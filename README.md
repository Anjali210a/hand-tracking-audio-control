# Hand-Tracking-Audio-Control
This project integrates advanced hand tracking technology for touchless audio control. By utilizing computer vision and gesture recognition, users can effortlessly manage playback, volume, and other media functions with simple hand movements, creating a smooth and intuitive user experience.

Key Features:

Gesture Recognition: Tracks hand movements for precise audio control.

Real-Time Interaction: Adjust volume, play/pause, skip, and more with gestures.

Touchless Control: Ideal for hands-free environments or accessibility needs.

Technologies Used:

Hand Tracking: MediaPipe or OpenCV for gesture detection.

Audio Control: Python with PyAudio/Pygame for playback control.

Computer Vision: OpenCV for camera integration.

This project redefines user interaction by providing an accessible, touchless, and intuitive way to control media, enhancing both convenience and accessibility.
